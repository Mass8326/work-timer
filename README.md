# Work Timer
A small stopwatch that keeps track of the time you spend in certain programs. Only works on Windows operating systems. Reworked from Neil Cicierega's app that can be found here: http://neilblr.com/post/58757345346.

## How to use
Left click on the GUI to move it around the desktop. Right click to open the context menu. Click on a program slot in the menu, then switch to the program you want to be tracked. If you want to remove a program, click its slot and then switch to your desktop.
